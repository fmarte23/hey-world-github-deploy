    <p>Hello there! I am Franz Marte, a highly-motivated entry-level web developer who is driven and passionate to find solutions to various problems in the ever-evolving world of tech. With a military and medical background in the field and in research, I perform and adapt well in a fast-paced environment bringing to the table resiliency, efficiency, discipline, and teamwork. I always keep an open mind and I am very passionate about applying and honing my skills in JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.  </p>
    <p>With a background in adjudications as an  Immigration Services Officer I have fulfilled the mission and vision and goals of USCIS to administer the nation’s lawful immigration system by safeguarding its integrity to protect Americans and their homeland. I was also formerly a dedicated and experienced Hospital Corpsman, Surgical Technician, and Urology Technician who, through didactic and supervised practice, has acquired the knowledge and developed skills necessary for performing various procedures in the clinical, laboratory, and surgical setting. I have a strong medical background and learned the ability to adapt to change and unpredictable fluctuations in workload volume at the nation’s leading military medical facility of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. My standout performance led me to being selected to manage a $5.5M equipment inventory and an annual $700K consumable budget. I am also a dynamic and versatile Research Scientist with extensive detailed research and experimental experience in Bioinformatics and Cancer Genomics. </p>
